## Happy to see everyone.

I am  **Sinan Thahir**, currently working as a ***Research Analyst*** based on  [Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala](https://trivandrum.nic.in/). Academically, I'm a graduate *mechanical engineer* though my passion in analytics and programming had lead me to be a *self-taught* **Data Analyst**. Currently developing skills in *Machine Learning*, *NLP* and *Management studies*.

Besides loving my career and tech hustle, I love to read books, niche anime watcher, writing articles and gaming. As a technical writer, I used to write in  [Medium](https://sinanthahir.medium.com/) but the first few minutes spent on hashnode, made me fall in love with it ðŸ¥°; specially the open to read all content.

On hashnode, I wish to write my learning paths as a beginner on *data science, statistics, machine learning* as well as my experience being *research analyst*. Please follow me on this blog and subscribe to my newsletter to not miss reading my latest articles.

Like one of my preferred quotes *"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much."* by Helen Keller;
